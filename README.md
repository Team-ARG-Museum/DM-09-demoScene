A demo for the Arduboy with 4 channel synth music

I wanted to create a demo with the same feel and looks as the keygen, crack and demo's from back in the Amiga days. And this one has even 4 channel synth music going with it !!!

Now you should be able to just upload this to your DEV kit and the retail Arduboys.

#IMPORTANT: DO NOT PRESS THE RIGHT BUTTON ON THE DEV KIT !!!
If you do, you short a pin on the kit.
So you want to hear music on the DEV kit too? Connect a small speaker, buzzer or piezo to the right button and you'll hear music ! How cool is that ;-) (put it in parallel with the button)
